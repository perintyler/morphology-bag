# Layout Ratios

A system for spacing and proportion that replaces arbitrary pixel values with mathematically grounded ratios. Produces layouts that feel "right" because they're built on the same proportional relationships found in nature, typography, and the best design systems.

## When to Use This Skill

Load this skill when you're generating any HTML layout — articles, landing pages, dashboards, reports — and need to determine spacing, column widths, font sizes, or element proportions. It provides a concrete system so you never have to guess at padding or margin values.

## The Two Systems

### 1. The 8-Point Grid (from Material Design)

All spacing values should be multiples of 8px. This creates visual rhythm — every gap, margin, and padding relates to every other one.

**The scale**: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 96, 120

Use 4px increments only for fine adjustments (icon padding, border offsets, baseline shifts).

**Application**:
- Padding inside containers: 16, 24, or 32px
- Gap between paragraphs: 24px
- Gap between a heading and its first paragraph: 8 or 16px (they're a unit)
- Gap before a new section heading: 64 or 72px
- Page-level padding (mobile): 16 or 24px
- Page-level padding (desktop): 32 or 40px

### 2. The Phi Scale (from the Golden Ratio)

For relationships between *different-sized* elements, use the golden ratio (1.618) or Fibonacci-approximated values.

**Typography scale** (phi-based, starting from body size):

| Role | Calculation | At 18px base | At 16px base |
|------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Small / caption | base ÷ 1.618 | 11px | 10px |
| Body | base | 18px | 16px |
| Large body / lead | base × 1.25 | 22px | 20px |
| Subheading | base × 1.618 | 29px | 26px |
| Heading | base × 1.618² | 47px | 42px |
| Display | base × 1.618³ | 76px | 68px |

**Spacing scale** (Fibonacci, approximating phi ratios):

8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89

- **8–13px**: micro spacing (within a component, icon gaps, inline code padding)
- **21px**: standard spacing (between paragraphs, list items)
- **34px**: moderate spacing (between a code block and surrounding text, between subsections)
- **55px**: section spacing (between the end of one section and the heading of the next)
- **89px**: major spacing (above the first section heading after the hero, before footer)

### Column Proportions

**The golden split for content + margin**:

At any container width, the content column should occupy roughly 61.8% and the combined margins 38.2%. This maps to:

| Container | Content column | Each margin |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 1440px | ~890px (too wide for text) | ~275px |
| 1100px | ~680px | ~210px |
| 900px | ~556px (narrow) | ~172px |
| 768px | ~475px | ~146px |
| 375px (mobile) | 375 – 48 = 327px | 24px each |

For longform articles, **680px** (at 18–19px body text) yields ~65 characters per line — the reading comfort zone.

**Wide elements** should not jump to full container width. Use a stepped system:
- Narrow (content column): 680px — body text
- Medium (content × 1.25): ~850px — code blocks, tables, diagrams
- Wide (content × 1.618): ~1100px — hero, full-bleed images, dramatic pull quotes

## Applying the System

### Step 1: Establish the base unit

Pick a body font size (typically 16–19px for articles). This is your base unit.

### Step 2: Derive the type scale

Multiply up by 1.618 for each heading level. Divide by 1.618 for captions/small text. Round to whole pixels.

### Step 3: Set the spacing scale

Use the Fibonacci sequence anchored to your 8-point grid: 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. Map these to your layout:

```
/* Spacing tokens */
--space-xs: 8px;    /* micro: icon gaps, inline padding */
--space-sm: 13px;   /* tight: within components */
--space-md: 21px;   /* standard: between paragraphs */
--space-lg: 34px;   /* moderate: around code blocks, between subsections */
--space-xl: 55px;   /* section: between major sections */
--space-2xl: 89px;  /* major: hero-to-content, before footer */
```

### Step 4: Set column widths

Content column at ~680px. Medium breakout at ~850px. Wide breakout at ~1100px. Use negative margins from the content column to achieve medium/wide, so the reading spine stays centered.

### Step 5: Vertical rhythm rules

- **Heading + its content** = one unit. Space between them: `--space-xs` (8px) to `--space-sm` (13px).
- **Between paragraphs**: `--space-md` (21px).
- **Around a breakout element** (code block, image, table): `--space-lg` (34px) above and below.
- **Before a new section heading**: `--space-xl` (55px).
- **After the hero, before the first body content**: `--space-2xl` (89px).

### Step 6: Validate

Open at 1440px. Scroll. Ask:
- Is the spacing between every pair of elements *intentional* and *different* based on their relationship?
- Does the type hierarchy feel natural — each level clearly distinct but not jarring?
- Do wide elements feel like deliberate departures from the spine, not random width changes?

Resize to 375px. The Fibonacci spacing scale should compress (use the next-smaller value) but the *ratios* between levels should hold.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Uniform spacing** — Using the same margin everywhere. A section break needs 55px, a paragraph break needs 21px. If they're both 32px, the layout feels flat.

2. **Arbitrary values** — Picking 47px because it "looks right." Use 48 (8-grid) or 55 (Fibonacci). Systems prevent drift across a long document.

3. **Heading orphaned from its content** — A heading with 55px below it and 55px above it belongs to neither section. Use 55px *above* (separating from previous section) and 8–13px *below* (binding to its own content).

4. **Width jumps without mediation** — Going from 680px body text directly to a 1100px element and back. Use the medium step (850px) or add a background color change to signal the transition.

5. **Ignoring the reading column on wide screens** — At 1440px, 680px of text leaves 760px of white space. That's fine — it's the magazine convention. Don't stretch text to fill the screen.
