# Material Design: Understanding Layout

## Principles

1. **Predictable** — Use intuitive and predictable layouts with consistent UI regions and spatial organization.
2. **Consistent** — Layouts should use grids, keylines, and padding consistently.
3. **Responsive** — Layouts are adaptive. They react to input from users, devices, and screen elements.

## Layout Anatomy

A layout has three main regions:
- **App bar** — displays primary actions, grouped and anchored to edges
- **Navigation** — helps users navigate between destinations
- **Body** — displays most content (lists, cards, buttons, images)

### Body Region Scaling

The body scales across breakpoints with specific margin and column behavior:

| Screen | Width | Margin | Body | Columns |
|--------|-------|--------|------|---------|
| Extra-small (phone) | 0–599dp | 16dp | Fluid | 4 |
| Small (tablet) | 600–904 | 32dp | Fluid | 8 |
| Small (tablet) | 905–1239 | Fluid | 840dp fixed | 12 |
| Medium (laptop) | 1240–1439 | 200dp | Fluid | 12 |
| Large (desktop) | 1440+ | Fluid | 1040dp fixed | 12 |

**Key insight**: margins start small (16dp), grow to 32dp, then become fluid, and the body itself eventually gets a max-width (840dp, then 1040dp). The body never stretches infinitely.

## Composition

### Visual Grouping
Elements with similar content or functionality are grouped using open space, typography, and dividers. This is the first step to creating order.

### Containment
Two methods for grouping related elements:
- **Implicit containment** — reduce space between related elements, increase space outside the group. Proximity alone creates the boundary.
- **Explicit containment** — add an outline, card, or elevation level to create a visible boundary.

### Scaling with Text
**Ideal line length: 40–60 characters.** When elements contain text, margins and typographic properties should be responsive to ensure lines don't extend too long. When longer line lengths are necessary, increase line height to improve readability.

### Anchors and Constraints
When scaling, internal elements can be anchored to left, right, or center. Components should accommodate ergonomic needs — a horizontal card on mobile can become more square on desktop for prominence.

## Material Measurements

**The 8dp grid**: Most measurements align to 8dp increments for consistent visual rhythm. Smaller elements (icons) use a 4dp grid. Typography sits on a 4dp baseline grid (each line's baseline spaced in 4dp increments).

## Takeaways for Article Layout

1. **Body max-width matters** — Material caps the body at 840dp (small) to 1040dp (large). For articles, the reading column should similarly cap around 680–720px, not stretch.

2. **Margins grow with viewport** — Small screens get tight margins (16dp), larger screens get generous margins (200dp at laptop). The content doesn't just float centered; the margins adapt.

3. **The 8dp grid creates rhythm** — All spacing (padding, margins, gaps) should be multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80. This prevents arbitrary spacing and creates visual consistency.

4. **Implicit containment = proximity** — You don't need borders or background colors to group elements. Just bring related things closer and push unrelated things apart. This is the cheapest, most elegant grouping tool.

5. **40–60 character line length** — Material confirms the same reading comfort zone. For 19px body text, this maps to roughly 640–700px column width.
