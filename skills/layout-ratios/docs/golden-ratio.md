# Golden Ratio in Design

## The Number

**Φ = 1.618** (phi)

A line split into two parts where:
- The ratio of the whole line to the longer segment = 1.618
- The ratio of the longer segment to the shorter = 1.618

Closely tied to the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...) — as numbers increase, the ratio between consecutive numbers approaches 1.618.

## Three Forms

### Golden Rectangle
A rectangle with sides in 1:1.618 proportion. Can be subdivided infinitely into smaller golden rectangles. Used as the foundational grid for compositions.

### Golden Circles
Circles inscribed inside each rectangle segment. Diameters match the side lengths of corresponding squares. When overlapped and rearranged, they act as placement guides for proportional spacing.

### Golden Spiral
A logarithmic spiral that grows outward while maintaining 1:1.618 proportion. Created by drawing arcs through nested golden rectangles. Guides the viewer's eye across a composition, creating natural visual flow.

## Applications

### Web Design
- Golden spirals define website layouts by organizing content toward CTAs
- Golden ratio grids define button placements, column widths, screen layouts
- Column width example: 1000px → 618px main column + 382px sidebar

### Typography
- Font size hierarchy using phi scaling: if body is 16px, heading = 16 × 1.618 ≈ 26px, large heading = 26 × 1.618 ≈ 42px
- Leading (line-height) can follow: 16px × 1.618 ≈ 26px line-height (1.618 ratio)

### Logo Design
Many famous logos use overlapping golden circles for natural balance. The golden rectangle ensures proportional consistency at different scales.

## Practical Application

### Creating a golden ratio grid:
1. Start with frame width (e.g., 1000px)
2. Divide by 1.618: 1000 / 1.618 = 618px
3. Divide again: 618 / 1.618 = 382px
4. Again: 382 / 1.618 = 236px
5. Again: 236 / 1.618 = 146px

These divisions create guide positions for element placement.

### Combining with other principles:
- **Rule of thirds** — place focal points where golden ratio intersects with thirds gridlines
- **Grid systems** — use golden rectangles to define column widths
- **Hierarchy and spacing** — apply phi scaling (× 1.618) to font sizes, margins, element spacing
- **Symmetry** — use symmetry for main layout, golden ratio for detail placement

## When NOT to Use It

- Abstract or extremely minimalist designs where proportional harmony isn't the goal
- When it threatens usability or readability
- Always prioritize practical design needs and accessibility

## Takeaways for Article Layout

1. **The phi scale for typography**: body 18px → subhead 29px → heading 47px → display 76px. Each step multiplied by 1.618. This creates natural size hierarchy that *feels* right without being arbitrary.

2. **Column proportions**: a 1000px container splits into 618px + 382px. For articles: a ~680px reading column in a ~1100px container means ~420px of margin/whitespace — close to the golden split.

3. **Spacing scale**: instead of arbitrary margins, use a phi-based scale. If base unit = 8px: 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. (Fibonacci numbers, which approximate phi ratios.) This gives tight spacing (8, 13) for within-section, moderate (21, 34) for between elements, generous (55, 89) for between sections.

4. **The spiral as reading flow**: content should guide the eye in a natural path — the most important element (hero) gets the most space, then the eye is drawn inward/downward to progressively detailed content. The spiral isn't literal but the *feeling* of it should be there.
